# SCCMaker
I made this program for the purpose of creating captions for YouTube videos,
made for someone else that posts videos semi-regularly to YouTube, and for myself
(if I ever decided to post anything), but since I made it using the same standard
that television broadcasts use, with all the effects and everything--in fact,
the whole thing was based on
[this site I found](http://www.theneitherworld.com/mcpoodle/SCC_TOOLS/DOCS/SCC_FORMAT.HTML)--it
could *theoretically* be used in actual North American television broadcasts.
Though, I'd say... Don't do that. At least, not without asking me first
(wink, wink, nudge, nudge, please tell me if you're going to do anything like that. Seriously).

This *is* still under relatively active development, though, so some stuff you may find
here may end up being changed later.
